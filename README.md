# Discord_Bot
Small bot I wrote for an RP server on discord.
The main goal of the bot is to enchance Roleplay by dealing with annoying manual things, like calculations.
It is also used to keep track of nation information so admins can be more informed.
The final version is planned to contain:
- Map mechanics
- Nation profiles
- Population & Economy tracking
- Space battle Auto-Resolve
- Tracking of fleets
